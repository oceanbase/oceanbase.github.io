This method is applicable to scenarios with a small amount of data. Incremental refresh, by contrast, only deals with data that has been changed since the last refresh. To achieve accurate incremental refresh, OceanBase Database implements a materialized view log feature that is similar to Oracle Materialized View Log (MLOG).

Data in the materialized structures is then merged and sorted.

In a partition, metadata is split into multiple subclasses for hierarchical storage. In scenarios where background tasks require deeper metadata, the data read consumes more I/O resources. These I/O overheads are not a problem for local SSD disks, but may affect system performance when HDD disks or cloud disks are used. OceanBase Database V4.3.0 aggregates frequently accessed metadata in storage, and only one I/O operation is required to access the metadata. This greatly reduces the I/O overhead in zero load scenarios and avoids the impact on foreground query performance caused by background task I/O overhead.
