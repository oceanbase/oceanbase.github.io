The high compression ratio of OceanBase Database significantly reduces disk storage requirements. However, in scenarios involving massive historical archives, companies still face challenges such as insufficient storage and waste of computing resources. This article explores the feasibility of a hybrid storage configuration, where transaction logs (or clogs) are stored on SSDs and business data is stored on HDDs. Through an exhaustive verification process, we evaluate the performance degradation and stability of the hybrid configuration compared to an all-flash configuration across different specifications and scenarios. By incorporating real-world use cases in production environments, this article serves as a reference for deploying OceanBase Database in scenarios involving massive data. While ensuring business stability and performance, the hybrid configuration can significantly reduce hardware resource usage, address shortages in flash resources, and make better use of existing resources.","permalink":"/docs/blogs/users/Hybrid-Storage-Deploy"},{"id":"blogs/users/financial-industry","title":"Case Study of Selecting OceanBase Database in the Financial Industry","description":"The application of OceanBase Database in the financial industry has yielded remarkable results.
