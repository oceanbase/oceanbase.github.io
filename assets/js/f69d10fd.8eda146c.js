The join filter that contains the partition ID will be used on Operator 8 for partition pruning for the right-side table of the hash join. When the table scan operator scans each partition in the right-side table, it will verify whether the partition ID exists in the join filter. If not, it can skip the entire partition."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"A join filter can be used for data pre-filtering and partition pruning, thereby reducing the overheads in data scan, network transmission, and hash table probes.
