A physical restore is completed only after all the data (minor compaction data and baseline data) and logs are restored. Then, users can log in to and use the restored tenant. If a large amount of data is to be restored to a tenant, the restore will take a long time and users need to reserve sufficient disk space for the tenant at the very beginning to ensure a successful restore.
