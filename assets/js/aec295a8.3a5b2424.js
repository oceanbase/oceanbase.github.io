When the incremental data in memory reaches the specified threshold, it is flushed to disks (a process called "minor compaction"). During off-peak hours at night, the system automatically merges incremental baseline data with existing baseline data (a process called "major compaction"). Handling incremental data in this quasi-memory approach greatly enhances the performance of INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations. In addition, OceanBase Database applies aggressive compression algorithms on the baseline data, which is read-only. This ensures a high compression ratio without affecting the query performance. To ensure data persistence, redo logs are written to disks and synchronized to follower replicas while incremental data is written to memory. A transaction is considered successful only when the majority of replicas have successfully persisted the redo logs. Both minor and major compactions involve intensive disk I/O operations. To maintain high database performance, OceanBase officially recommends deploying clusters on SSD storage.'}),"\n",(0,s.jsxs)(n.p,{children:["From our perspective, SSDs are primarily used to boost performance.
