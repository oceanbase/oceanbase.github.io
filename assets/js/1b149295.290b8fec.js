The transaction recovery solutions for standalone and distributed databases that we have discussed in this article demonstrate how database technology has evolved to keep pace with hardware advancements. What does the future hold? With larger memory capacities, faster networks, cheaper disks, and even the widespread use of non-volatile memory, the possibilities for database technology are vast. We are excited to see what the future brings.
