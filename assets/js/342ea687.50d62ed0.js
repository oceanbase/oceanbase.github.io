A tenant is a logical unit designed for resource isolation. The data security of tenants is guaranteed by privilege control. Tenants are critical for system O&M, especially for the O&M of cloud databases. In a sense, tenants are comparable to "instances" in a conventional database system. In OceanBase Database, tenants are totally isolated, which prevents cross-tenant access and ensures that data assets of a tenant cannot be used by other tenants. Therefore, we can migrate our business modules hosted in multiple MySQL instances to different tenants of one OceanBase cluster, without worrying about data security.
