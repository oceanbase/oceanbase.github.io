A distributed database is often deployed on multiple servers to ensure high availability and performance. Therefore, to handle small-scale simple scenarios in the early days of their business, users tend to deploy a centralized database that costs less and exhibits higher performance if small specifications. The problem is, sooner or later, the centralized database will be bottlenecked as the business size grows, and adjustments or restructuring of the database architecture by then can be extremely challenging and costly."})]})}function h(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,i.R)(),...e.components};return t?(0,n.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,n.jsx)(d,{...e})}):d(e)}},8453:(e,t,a)=>{a.d(t,{R:()=>o,x:()=>r});var n=a(6540);const i={},s=n.createContext(i);function o(e){const t=n.useContext(s);return n.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(t):{...t,...e}}),[t,e])}function r(e){let t;return t=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(i):e.components||i:o(e.components),n.createElement(s.Provider,{value:t},e.children)}}}]);
