Why not directly divide the loads among different servers? For example, transaction processing (TP) and analytical processing (AP) loads can be routed to different replicas on different servers, and different tenants can be deployed on different servers to implement physical isolation. As I see it, that is truly a simple and convenient solution. However, it has many limitations, and cost is the biggest concern. Assume that a game company has two tenants A and B, where tenant A processes services outside China and tenant B processes services inside China. The load peaks of one tenant coincide with the load troughs of the other and vice versa due to the time zone difference.

For example, operations such as backup, migration, and reorganization in a database strongly depend on intensive data reads and writes.

Rigid resources can be clearly isolated like cutting a cake. However, for flexible resources, contention between loads must be considered.
