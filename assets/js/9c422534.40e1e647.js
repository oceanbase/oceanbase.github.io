In remote execution, if all data required in a transaction is located on another server, OceanBase Database forwards the transaction to that server, which will access the storage, process the data, commit the transaction, and then return the results. If the data required in an SQL statement is located on many servers, to consume the minimal overhead comparable to serial execution on a standalone server, OceanBase Database performs distributed execution, pushes the computing tasks to each server for local processing, and then aggregates the results.
