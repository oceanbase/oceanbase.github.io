The measured execution time is 4.47 ms at OBClient, 4.366 ms at OBProxy, and 3.246 ms at the OBServer node. Based on the normal time consumption of each end, we can come to the conclusion that the OBServer node took the most time in the execution. Going deeper, we can see that a large part of the time was consumed at the SQL compile stage, at which the SQL execution plan was generated. We can now come to a preliminary conclusion that the execution of this SQL request was slow because it failed to hit the execution plan."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:(0,a.jsx)(t.img,{alt:"1678086219",src:n(71004).A+"",width:"1080",height:"666"})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:(0,a.jsx)(t.em,{children:"Figure 10 End-to-end tracing details presented on OCP"})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"On the end-to-end tracing details page on OCP, we can see the path by which the SQL request calls each module, and the time consumption of each stage.

However, if users want to know the time consumed from OBClient initiating the request to OBProxy receiving the request, they can click the span of OBClient and that of OBProxy respectively.
