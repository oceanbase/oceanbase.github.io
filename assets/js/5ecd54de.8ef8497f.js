Before OceanBase Database's distributed architecture, DBAs often had to handle failures, such as primary or standby database outages, during off-hours, sometimes with response times as tight as 10 minutes. OceanBase Database's automated failover capabilities have significantly reduced this burden. In the vast majority of failure scenarios, DBA intervention is unnecessary. Even in less common outages, the system typically recovers automatically within 8 seconds. This demonstrates how distributed technology drastically improves distributed disaster recovery capabilities."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(a.p,{children:"How does OceanBase Database, as a native distributed database, differ from databases that implement distributed transactions on top of sharding? Consider the classic two-phase commit problem: if the coordinator fails, distributed transactions can become blocked, as dictated by the protocol itself. OceanBase Database addresses this issue fundamentally. Because OceanBase Database participants are highly available, maintained by a three-replica architecture, they do not lose their state. This inherent high availability allows OceanBase Database to effectively eliminate a phase from the traditional two-phase commit process. This not only improves performance but also prevents suspended transactions, significantly reducing the operational burden on DBAs."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(a.p,{children:"Third, emergency response. OceanBase Database provides built-in emergency measures that can be manually triggered at the database kernel level. These include operations like follower-to-leader switchover and SQL throttling, such as limiting QPS per statement.

Thirteen years ago, we began as a small internal project with the simple goal of using technology to simplify the management and use of massive datasets. With the help and support of thousands of customers, OceanBase Database has evolved from version 1.x to 4.x, progressing from a native distributed architecture to an integrated architecture supporting both standalone and distributed deployments.

During the development of OceanBase Database V1.0, even with numerous ongoing tasks, our founder, Yang, insisted we pause everything and spend over a month refactoring our entire codebase to meticulously check every C++ return value. This commitment to quality is reflected in our open source code today. We encourage you to explore the OceanBase Database code and report any unchecked return values as bugs. This dedication to building a robust and reliable product is a responsibility we take seriously, both for the long-term success of OceanBase Database and for our customers.
