However in a distributed scenario, 100 execution plans may be generated considering parallel execution. It is difficult to select the best one among 100 plans. In many databases or conventional research, a compromise strategy will be used for optimization in such a scenario. Specifically, the system will generate the optimal serial plan based on the assumption that all tables are non-partitioned tables located on the same server, and then convert the serial plan into a distributed and parallel plan."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"If we do so, what will happen?"}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:(0,n.jsx)(t.img,{src:"https://obcommunityprod.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/prod/blog/2023-05/1684722987752.png",alt:"1684722989"})}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Let's see an actual case in a banking business scenario. In a two-table join, the referenced tables are both T1 and a subquery is used for grouping and aggregation for T1. If T1 is a non-partitioned table, the query performance is stable, with a response time (RT) of 2s. If T1 is a partitioned table, slow queries with an RT of 15s will occasionally occur. Why is that?"}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Analytics show that in a serial scenario (the first chart on the right), the two optimal execution plans respectively perform a merge join or nested loop join on the two tables. The performance of the two plans is very close, with an RT of about 2s. The performance of the merge join is slightly higher. After T1 is partitioned, a partition-level iteration will be incorporated into execution plans. Then, the RT of the merge join is still about 2s. For the nested loop join, the number of executions of the right branch is subject to the number of rows in the left-side table. Since the left-side table in the join contains 20,000 rows, data in the right-side table needs to be calculated for 20,000 times. This means the partition-level iteration is amplified by 20,000 times, increasing the RT to 15s."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"We find that conventional optimization is not suitable for distributed scenarios.
