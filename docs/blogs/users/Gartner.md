**1 OceanBase Cloud is Coming to the Fore, Serving More Than 700 Customers in Just Two Years**
--------------------------------

The global market share of cloud databases is growing. According to *Forecast Analysis: Database Management Systems, Worldwide*, research conducted by Gartner in August 2024, the spending on cloud dbPaaS will increase from 61% of the entire database management system (DBMS) market in 2023 to 78% in 2028.

As early as 2022, OceanBase officially launched OceanBase Cloud, its cloud database product, taking a key step in its cloud strategy. Based on its capabilities such as multi-level auto scaling, large-scale cost reduction, hybrid transaction/analytical processing (HTAP) real-time analysis, and multi-infrastructure, OceanBase Cloud provides customers with integrated cloud database services.

**In 2024, OceanBase Cloud emerged as the second growth curve within OceanBase,** serving more than 700 customers with an annual customer growth rate of up to 130%. **At the same time, OceanBase Cloud has accelerated its global expansion**, covering more than 100 zones in more than 30 geographic regions in the Americas, Europe, and Asia, providing consistent cloud database services to customers worldwide. It also supports the infrastructure of mainstream public clouds including Alibaba Cloud, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud, Huawei Cloud, and Tencent Cloud.

OceanBase Cloud has achieved leapfrog development, expanding globally within two years after its launch.

- **Conventional database migration to the cloud:** Fully compatible with MySQL and Oracle, OceanBase Cloud provides an automatic upgrade solution that integrates data migration, real-time data synchronization, and incremental data subscription. This solution ensures smooth migration of applications in scenarios such as the migration of offline databases to the cloud, replacement of self-managed databases on the cloud, and hybrid database deployment on and off the cloud.

- **High concurrency:** OceanBase Cloud has developed a log-structured merge-tree (LSM-tree) architecture for storage and computing based on more than ten years of experience from Alipay in the extreme scenarios of "Double 11." This architecture supports multi-level auto scaling to flexibly use cloud resources and provide nearly unlimited processing capabilities. During off-peak hours, quick scale-in is performed to significantly reduce resource usage costs.

- **HTAP real-time analysis:** OceanBase Cloud joins online transaction processing (OLTP) and online analytical processing (OLAP) workloads to meet the requirements for transaction processing and real-time analysis. This year, OceanBase Database V4.3.3, the first General Availability (GA) version of OceanBase Database, is released for real-time analytical processing (AP) scenarios, which uses columnstore replicas to greatly improve data processing efficiency.

- **Multi-model integration:** In addition to traditional structured data, OceanBase Cloud also supports a variety of data types including JSON, XML, and GIS. It can store massive data in key-value pairs and is compatible with multi-model database systems such as HBase and Redis. In OceanBase Database V4.2.5, the long-term support (LTS) version released this year, OBKV-Redis and OBKV-HBase are supported to provide more efficient data processing capabilities for key business scenarios.

- **Multi-cloud unified technology stack:** As a native distributed database service, OceanBase Cloud does not rely on underlying hardware and is compatible with infrastructure, such as load balancers and object storage, of major cloud vendors. This prevents customers from being affected by the instability of single-cloud infrastructure and ensures business stability and continuity.

  

**3 OceanBase Cloud Builds a Cloud Foundation for Data from Various Industries**
-------------------------------
