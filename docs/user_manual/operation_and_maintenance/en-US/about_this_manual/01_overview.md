In the first half of 2024, we provided a [getting-started tutorial](https://oceanbase.github.io/docs/user_manual/quick_starts/en-US/chapter_01_overview_of_the_oceanbase_database/introduction) for beginners of OceanBase Database Community Edition. The tutorial covers topics such as the installation and deployment of OceanBase clusters, data migration, and database testing.

As users become more familiar with OceanBase Database, we will release a tutorial for those who are conducting proof of concept (POC) tests and have deployed OceanBase Database for their business. This tutorial, titled *OceanBase Advanced Tutorial for DBAs*, will cover the following sections:

+ Best practices for different scenarios
+ Troubleshooting manuals for the platform tools and database kernel
+ Application development specifications

> Note: At present, *OceanBase Advanced Tutorial for DBAs* applies only to OceanBase Database Community Edition. Therefore, the arbitration replica feature of OceanBase Database Enterprise Edition is not included in the tutorial outline provided in this topic. For more information about the differences between the two editions, see [Differences between Enterprise Edition and Community Edition](https://en.oceanbase.com/docs/common-oceanbase-database-10000000001714481).
