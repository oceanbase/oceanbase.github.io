For more information about limitations on ODC, see [Limitations](https://en.oceanbase.com/docs/common-odc-10000000001510644).

## Deployment

ODC is provided in two forms: Client ODC and Web ODC. Web ODC supports single-node deployment and high availability (HA) deployment. We recommend that you use Web ODC.

### Web ODC

Web ODC allows you to work in Individual Workspace mode or Team Workspace mode. Individual Workspace is suitable for individual developers and allows you to use features of Client ODC in a browser. You can access and create data sources as needed and develop databases with various windows and tools provided on the platform. Team Workspace is ideal for developers and database administrators (DBAs) to collaborate with each other. It is both a development tool and a collaborative management platform. ODC provides a variety of database development and management features, such as project collaboration, stable change, data security, and hot/cold data separation.

#### Single-node deployment

For more information about the single-node deployment mode of Web ODC, see [Deploy ODC on a single node](https://en.oceanbase.com/docs/common-odc-10000000001198207).

#### HA deployment

For more information about the HA deployment mode of Web ODC, see [Deploy ODC in high-availability mode](https://en.oceanbase.com/docs/common-odc-10000000001198205).

#### Check the deployment

After Web ODC is deployed, you can use the IP address and port number, for example, `<http://IP:PORT>` or `<http://DOMAIN:PORT>`, of the host (where the NGINX proxy resides in HA deployment) to access Web ODC in a browser.

After you log on to Web ODC, the homepage appears. If you are logging on to Web ODC for the first time, register an account and then log on. If you can create a connection and operate the database normally in ODC, it indicates that Web ODC is deployed successfully.

### Client ODC

Client ODC focuses on database development. It is lightweight and easy to deploy on Windows, macOS, and Linux. While functioning as a tool platform, Web ODC also provides collaborative management features to ensure the security, compliance, and efficiency of database changes. For more information about the deployment method, see [Install Client ODC](https://en.oceanbase.com/docs/common-odc-10000000001510683).

## Use ODC for SQL development

### Data sources

A data source is a remote database environment, such as a standalone OceanBase cluster or an instance of another database system.

![Data sources](/img/user_manual/quick_starts/en-US/chapter_06_using_ob_for_business_development/02_using_odc_for_sql_development/002.png)

#### Configure a data source

* ODC supports the following types of data sources: OceanBase Database in MySQL and Oracle mode, OceanBase Cloud in MySQL and Oracle mode, OB Sharding MySQL, and MySQL.

* You must specify the following parameters when you configure a data source:

  * Host IP address: the IP address or domain name of the data source.

  * Port: the port number of the data source.

  * Database username: the username of a database user for accessing the database.

  * Database password: the password of the database user.

* The following parameters are exclusive to OceanBase Database: cluster name and tenant name.

* If the data source is OceanBase-Cloud, cluster name and tenant name are not required, and the host IP address must be the domain name of the data source.

* The **Environment** parameter specifies the environment type of the data source, such as a development environment or production environment, to configure different control policies.

![Create data source](/img/user_manual/quick_starts/en-US/chapter_06_using_ob_for_business_development/02_using_odc_for_sql_development/003.png)

![Command-line Window tab](/img/user_manual/quick_starts/en-US/chapter_06_using_ob_for_business_development/02_using_odc_for_sql_development/007.png)

### SQL development

#### Edit and execute SQL statements

* Statement highlighting and formatting

  * Keywords are highlighted for you to catch key information at a glance.

  * SQL formatting:

    * The code is formatted based on the syntax, making the SQL statements pleasingly organized.

    * The code is expanded based on the syntax, making the SQL structure clear and easy to understand.

    Before formatting

    ![Before formatting](/img/user_manual/quick_starts/en-US/chapter_06_using_ob_for_business_development/02_using_odc_for_sql_development/008.png)

    After formatting

    ![After formatting](/img/user_manual/quick_starts/en-US/chapter_06_using_ob_for_business_development/02_using_odc_for_sql_development/009.png)

* Syntax prompts

  * ODC supports keyword prompts to minimize spelling errors.

    ![Keyword prompt](/img/user_manual/quick_starts/en-US/chapter_06_using_ob_for_business_development/02_using_odc_for_sql_development/010.png)

  * ODC supports database object prompts. This allows you to quickly find the target from numerous database objects.

    ![Object name prompt](/img/user_manual/quick_starts/en-US/chapter_06_using_ob_for_business_development/02_using_odc_for_sql_development/011.png)

  * ODC supports column name prompts based on the table that you are dealing with.

* SQL check

  * A number of rules are provided for comprehensive check.

  * The rules are derived from the best O&M practices of OceanBase Database, and are thus highly practical.

  * You can easily perform a check with a few clicks.

  * Risk levels are intelligently labeled to help you avoid risks.

  Built-in check rules:

  ![Execution duration](/img/user_manual/quick_starts/en-US/chapter_06_using_ob_for_business_development/02_using_odc_for_sql_development/021.png)

* Execution details

  * ODC displays the execution details of each SQL statement, such as the trace ID, execution duration, and execution plan.

  * ODC displays the entire execution process of an SQL statement, from the driver to OceanBase Database Proxy (ODP) and OBServer node, making end-to-end diagnostics possible.
