## Database proxy

### ODP

OceanBase Database Proxy (ODP) is a proxy server dedicated for OceanBase Database. Unlike other ecological tools described in this topic, ODP is a part of the OceanBase Database kernel that comprises OBServer nodes and ODP. OceanBase Database stores replicas of user data on multiple OBServer nodes. When receiving an SQL request from a user, ODP forwards the request to the optimal OBServer node and returns the execution result to the user. Core features of ODP include connection management, optimal routing, high-performance forwarding, easy O&M, high availability, and proprietary protocol. 

For more information, see [OceanBase Database Proxy](https://en.oceanbase.com/docs/common-odp-doc-en-10000000001177429). 

## Installation and deployment tools

### OCP

OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) is an enterprise-level management platform tailored for OceanBase clusters. It is compatible with all major OceanBase Database versions. It provides GUI-based management capabilities, including lifecycle management of database components and resources (such as hosts, networks, and software packages), fault recovery, performance diagnostics, as well as monitoring and alerting. OCP aims to help enterprises manage OceanBase clusters more efficiently at lower IT O&M costs and shorten the user learning curve. 

For more information about the system architecture and features of OCP, see [OceanBase Cloud Platform](https://en.oceanbase.com/docs/common-ocp-10000000001553919). 

### OCP Express

OCP Express is a web-based management tool for OceanBase Database V4.x. Integrated with OceanBase clusters, OCP Express allows you to view key performance metrics and perform basic database management operations on OceanBase clusters. 

OCP Express is derived from OCP. It retains the core capabilities of OCP and adjusts the overall layout of features to provide a brand-new user experience. Feature configurations are also rearranged in OCP Express so that OCP Express can be deployed on any database node with the minimum resource consumption. OCP Express allows you to gain extensive control over OceanBase Database V4.x at minimum costs. 

OCP Express is intended for lightweight O&M management and is integrated with the managed OceanBase cluster for dedicated management. It minimizes resource consumption while meeting basic O&M requirements. OCP is intended for the O&M of large-scale complex clusters, and you can manage multiple OceanBase clusters in OCP. It provides more management capabilities than OCP Express. An additional OceanBase cluster is needed to store the data of OCP, and higher resource configurations are needed to implement the capabilities of OCP. 

> **Note**
>
> OCP Express applies to the O&M of an OceanBase cluster in a development and testing environment with no more than 20 servers and 3 to 5 tenants. We recommend that you use OCP in a production environment. 

For more information about the system architecture and features of OCP Express, see [OCP Express](https://en.oceanbase.com/docs/common-oceanbase-database-10000000001375615). 

### OBD

OceanBase Deployer (OBD) allows you to install and deploy an OceanBase cluster on the CLI or GUI. OBD standardizes the complex configuration process to simplify cluster deployment. 

In CLI-based deployment, you can edit the configuration file to flexibly adjust the configurations. This deployment mode requires expertise and is suitable for users who have a deep understanding of OceanBase Database. In GUI-based deployment, you can easily deploy a cluster by following the wizard. This deployment mode is suitable for users who want to quickly experience OceanBase Database in a standard environment. 

Besides cluster deployment, OBD also provides general O&M capabilities such as the package manager, stress test software, and cluster management to deliver better user experience on OceanBase Database. 

For more information, see [OceanBase Deployer](https://en.oceanbase.com/docs/obd-en). 

### ob-operator

ob-operator is a tool built based on the Kubernetes Operator framework for managing OceanBase clusters on Kubernetes. It provides a simple and reliable way to implement containerized deployment of OceanBase clusters and simplifies the O&M of OceanBase clusters. ob-operator defines various resources for OceanBase Database and implements the corresponding coordination logic. It allows you to manage OceanBase clusters in a declarative manner, just as you would manage native Kubernetes resources. 

For more information about the features and usage instructions of ob-operator, see [Kubernetes Operator for OceanBase](https://en.oceanbase.com/docs/community-ob-operator-doc-en-10000000001195649). 

## Monitoring tools

### OCP / OCP Express

OCP and OCP Express not only allow you to create and manage clusters and tenants, but also provide features such as performance diagnostics, and monitoring and alerting. For more information, see the description of OCP and OCP Express in 'Installation and deployment tools'. 

### DOOBA

DOOBA is an internal O&M script of OceanBase Database that is developed in Python for performance monitoring. After you connect to the sys tenant of OceanBase Database by running a MySQL command, you can run DOOBA to display the queries per second (QPS) and the average response time (RT) of the SQL statements executed in the tenant in real time. The supported SQL types include `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, `INSERT`, `DELETE`, and `COMMIT`. You can also view the QPS and RT of SQL statements executed on each OBServer node. 

For more information, see [DOOBA](https://en.oceanbase.com/docs/common-oceanbase-database-10000000001375726). 

### OBAgent

OceanBase Agent (OBAgent) is a framework for monitoring data collection and O&M. 

* Monitoring data collection

   OBAgent supports data collection in pushing and pulling modes for different scenarios. By default, OBAgent supports plug-ins for server data collection, OceanBase Database metrics collection, log collection, monitoring data label processing, and HTTP service of the Prometheus protocol. OBAgent allows you to push data to Pushgateway, vmagent, Elasticsearch, Simple Log Service (SLS), and Alertmanager. You can also develop plug-ins to enable OBAgent to collect data from other sources or customize the data processing process. 

* O&M

   OBAgent allows you to configure hot updates. It also provides APIs for OBAgent O&M, file operations, and RPM package operations. You can use these APIs as needed. 

For more information, see the [obagent repository](https://github.com/oceanbase/obagent) on GitHub. 

## Migration and synchronization tools

### OMS

OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) is a service that supports data interaction between a homogeneous or heterogeneous data source and OceanBase Database. OMS provides the capabilities for online migration of existing data and real-time synchronization of incremental data. 

OMS Community Edition provides a visualized and centralized management platform. You can migrate data with simple configurations. OMS Community Edition aims to help you migrate and synchronize data in real time from homogeneous or heterogeneous data sources to OceanBase Database at a low cost and low risk. 

For more information, see [OceanBase Migration Service](https://en.oceanbase.com/docs/oms-en). 

### OBLogProxy

OBLogProxy is the incremental log proxy service of OceanBase Database. It establishes connections with OceanBase Database to read incremental logs and provides downstream services with change data capture (CDC) capabilities. 

OBLogProxy supports the following two modes: 

* The binlog mode of OBLogProxy is designed for compatibility with MySQL binlogs. It allows you to use MySQL binlog incremental parsing tools to synchronize OceanBase Database logs in real time. Thereby, you can smoothly use MySQL binlog tools with OceanBase Database. 

* OBLogProxy in CDC mode subscribes to data changes in OceanBase Database and synchronizes these data changes to downstream services in real time for real-time or quasi-realtime data replication and synchronization. 

For more information, see [OBLogProxy](https://en.oceanbase.com/docs/common-oceanbase-database-10000000001375722). 

### OBLOADER & OBDUMPER

OceanBase provides the data import tool OBLOADER and the data export tool OBDUMPER. 

OBLOADER provides extensive command-line options that allow you to import database object definitions and table data to OceanBase Database in complex scenarios. We recommend that you use OBLOADER in combination with OBDUMPER. You can also use OBLOADER to import files in the CSV format that are exported by using third-party tools, such as Navicat, MyDumper, and SQL Developer, to OceanBase Database. OBLOADER fully exploits the features of the distributed OceanBase Database system and is particularly optimized in import performance. 

You can use OBDUMPER to export table data from OceanBase Database to files in the SQL or CSV format. You can also use it to export objects defined in the database to files. 

For more information, see [OceanBase Loader and Dumper](https://en.oceanbase.com/docs/obloader-obdumper-en). 

## O&M tools

### OCP / OCP Express

In addition to creating and managing clusters and tenants, OCP also supports fault recovery, performance diagnostics, and monitoring and alerting. 

Unlike OCP, OCP Express does not support advanced O&M capabilities, such as backup and restore, version upgrade, and cluster scaling, aiming to reduce resource usage. OCP Express is more lightweight than OCP and is designed to meet the basic O&M and monitoring requirements of a single cluster. We recommend that you use OCP in a production environment. 

For more information, see the description of OCP and OCP Express in 'Installation and deployment tools'. 

### OBShell

OceanBase Shell (OBShell) is an out-of-the-box command-line tool provided by OceanBase Database Community Edition for O&M engineers and developers to manage local OceanBase clusters. OBShell supports cluster O&M and provides O&M and management APIs based on OceanBase Database. This allows products from different ecosystems to manage the same OceanBase cluster in a unified manner, reducing the difficulty in and costs of OceanBase cluster management. 

You do not need to separately install OBShell. As long as OceanBase Database Community Edition is installed, you can find the OBShell executable file in the `bin` directory under the working directory of each OBServer node. 

For more information, see [OBShell](https://en.oceanbase.com/docs/common-oceanbase-database-10000000001378072). 

### obdiag
