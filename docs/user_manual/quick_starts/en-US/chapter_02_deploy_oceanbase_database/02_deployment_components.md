# 2.2 Ecosystem components for deployment

Generally, OceanBase Deployer (OBD), OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP), and ob-operator are used to deploy OceanBase Database. The deployment tools apply to different scenarios.

* For enterprise users, OCP is recommended because it provides a wide range of O&M features that can facilitate O&M management in the future.

* For individual users or enterprise users with a few resources, OBD is recommended because this CLI-based tool consumes the fewest resources.

* For Kubernetes users, ob-operator is recommended because it allows the users to use OceanBase Database in line with their existing habits.

The following table compares the three deployment tools.

The following table describes the feature support of the tools.

> **Note**
>
> The feature support information in the following table is provided based on OBD V2.8.0, OCP V4.3.0, and ob-operator V2.2.0 (Dashboard V0.3.0). The feature support may vary across versions. To obtain accurate feature support information, see the official documentation for the specific version of the tool you are using.
