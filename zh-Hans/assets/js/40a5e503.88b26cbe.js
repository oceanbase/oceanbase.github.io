If we put two resource-demanding databases in the same instance, resource preemption may occur. In addition, some workloads have special requirements. For example, although payment transactions generate only a small amount of data, they have high business requirements. Therefore, a payment transaction database cannot be deployed in the same instance as other databases. Because of different businesses, different priorities, different data growth rates, and different QPS requirements, DBAs often need to "move eggs from one basket to another".

Here are the key points that contribute to the high performance of OceanBase Database:"}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(a.p,{children:"First, OceanBase Database offers both low latency and high throughput. For production business data, the proportion of single-server transactions in OceanBase Database can reach more than 80%. This is because, in OceanBase Database, data sharding is performed at the table or partition granularity. Therefore, if we update a non-partitioned table, or a single partition of a partitioned table, OceanBase Database can implement single-server transactions with low latency. Moreover, transactions involving multiple tables in the same server are also executed in single-server mode."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(a.p,{children:"Second, OceanBase Database allows users to use table groups to turn cross-server join operations into single-server transactions. The sound partition granularity design can ensure that 80% of transactions are single-server transactions. The proportion can be further improved by optimizing high-frequency cross-server join operations with table groups. The performance of the database will be superb if more than 90% of all business transactions are single-server transactions."}),"\n",(0,s.jsxs)(a.p,{children:["Third, OceanBase Database distinguishes query priorities. Small queries are given the top priority. Large queries occupy up to a percentage of the worker threads as defined in the ",(0,s.jsx)(a.code,{children:"large_query_worker_percentage"})," parameter. When there are no small queries, large queries can take 100% of the worker threads. The overall mechanism is similar to highway traffic rules, with large vehicles allowed to take the rightmost lane only, allowing other vehicles to overtake them in the passing lanes. This mechanism can prevent slow SQL queries and large queries from congesting the system or causing it to crash."]}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(a.p,{children:"These architecture designs and practical optimization ensure the high performance of OceanBase Database.

For example, if you start out with 2 CPU cores and 8 GB of memory and do not want to add nodes, you can scale up the tenant to 6 CPU cores and 12 GB of memory without adding any nodes. The whole process is dynamic and lossless without affecting or interrupting your business. Vertical scaling requires the DBA to run only a single SQL statement, greatly reducing the workload.
