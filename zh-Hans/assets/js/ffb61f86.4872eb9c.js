An important job of my team is to store the conversation records during the recruitment process into a database, which has held a tremendous amount of data and is taking in 500 million to 1 billion data records on a daily basis. However, these conversation records are rarely or never accessed or updated after they are written to the database. The growing volume of online data, especially the cold historical conversation records, has occupied petabytes of storage space of the online business database, resulting in serious waste of hardware resources and escalating IT costs. In addition to bloating the online business database, the increasing data volume also reduces the query efficiency, which hinders data changes and system scaling.'}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.p,{children:"To address these issues, we need to separate hot data from cold historical conversation records.
